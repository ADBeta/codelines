# codelines

codelines counts the number of lines in code files, ignoring comments, blank or 
empty lines and other non-valid lines - while counting every line of valid code.

It defaults to C/C++ styling but this can be changed via CLI options. 
The file input can be a list of files, a directory, or a single file. See --help 
for more information.

This program uses [TeFiEd](https://github.com/ADBeta/TeFiEd) for text handling,
and [CLIah](https://github.com/ADBeta/CLIah) for the Command line handling.
